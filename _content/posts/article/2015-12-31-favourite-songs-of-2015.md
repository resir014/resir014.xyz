As promised, here's a list of my favourite songs that were released throughout the year 2015. Keep in mind that this list is in no particular order. I hate ordering things.

## Wolfgun - Ghosts in the Graveyard

I've started to develop a loving towards Wolfgun since last year, when a friend of mine introduced me to one of their albums, LIGHTS. They've released several new tracks this year, and this is my favourite.

## Wolfgun - Unspoken

It's been a rough year for BBD, especially when he lost all of his equipments due to a robbery. Which is why this track was an awesome comeback, as well as a fine teaser for his next album, Tragame Tierra.

## Son Lux - Change Is Everything

Found in NPR's _All Songs Considered_ podcast, this track has a subtle glimmer of hope in it, which I find to be really nice.

## Skylar Spence - Fiona Coyne

Skylar Spence (previously Saint Pepsi) has matured really well since their Vaporwave phase with this release, Fiona Coyne, featured on their first album under the new name.

I've developed a weird liking to Professor Kliq, especially after hearing one of his songs from the [TrackMania2: Canyon trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77r-ghIOQso). He's released two new albums in the year 2015, and this is my favourite from one of the albums, _28 Days With The OP-1_.

Album: [28 Days With The OP-1](http://store.professorkliq.com/album/28-days-with-the-op-1)

## Professor Kliq - Sky Stage

Favourite track from Professor Kliq's other 2015 album, _The Scientific Method, Vol. III_.

## saib. - Souvenirs

I've always loved Cult Classic Records for their jazzy hip-hop beats, and this track (and the whole album itself) has become what has been resonating with me throughout the year.

Album: [Ipanema EP](https://cultclassicrecords.bandcamp.com/album/ipanema-ep)

## マクロス MACROSS 82-99 - Rainbow Roads (w Timid Soul)

All hail Future Funk! マクロス MACROSS 82-99 has pretty much made it one of my favourite subgenres of Vaporwave out there, and as much as the classic Vaporwave is dead, future funk is pretty much the one breathing new life into vaporwave.

Album: [CHAM!](https://macross82-99.bandcamp.com/album/cham)

## MNDR - Lock & Load (feat. Killer Mike)

<div class="video-wrapper">
  <iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/198839783&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

This song from the 60fps _Grand Theft Auto V_ trailer has been stuck to me since the first time I've heard it.

Album: [The Alchemist and Oh No Present: Welcome to Los Santos](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/alchemist-oh-no-present-welcome/id979725556)
