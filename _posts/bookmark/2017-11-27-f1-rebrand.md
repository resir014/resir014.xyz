Okay, a bit of an unpopular opinion: I don't think the new F1 logo is bad at all.

After reading through this article and seeing the whole rationale behind it, I can actually see how much the whole thing made sense and how the logo blends well with the graphics. [Someone on Mastodon](https://vulpine.club/@rey/99076546080675254) also brought up a good point about what the logo actually represents.

I guess it's just my immediate reaction to anything resembling retro-futuristic, Wipeout-like aesthetic, but still, I just don't get all the hate behind it.
