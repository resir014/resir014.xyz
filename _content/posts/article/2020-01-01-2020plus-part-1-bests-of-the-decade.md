Oh hey, look, a late "year end retrospective" entry!

Since the 2010s is coming to a close, it's time to look back into the things I've enjoyed, and a look back at my progress throughout the entire decade. I know I should've published this a few days ago. But then again, I started drafting this while on the way to a NYE party at an extended family's house, so this is the best you'll get.

_This is a two-part post. In Part 2, I'll do a [retrospective on the whole decade](/posts/2020/01/01/2020plus-part-2-an-entire-decades-retrospective/)._

## Album of the Decade

**M83 - Hurry Up, We're Dreaming (2011)**

Listening to M83 for the first time gives off that feeling you get when you wake up and you suddenly see everything through an Instagram filter. "Hurry Up, We're Dreaming" was the first album to really made me dig into the entire rabbit hole. There's a reason why it's the band I listen to the most.

If you have a moment, [do give it a listen](https://open.spotify.com/album/6R0ynY7RF20ofs9GJR5TXR).

## Games of the Decade

Yes, games. Plural.

This decade, I've played a lot of games, and many of them have grown to my all-time favourites. It's really hard to pick one that really sticks out among the rest.

Here's a list of them, in chronological order.

### Minecraft (2011)

Goes without saying here. This game changed my whole life.

### Elite: Dangerous (2014)

Another game I got really hooked into. I'm a sucker for simulation-esque type of games, and Elite really sticks out as this semi-realistic space exploration game. Unfortunately I lost a year of game time due to me not having a proper gaming PC, so I feel like missing out a lot. Would really love to get back into it though,

### Undertale (2015)

Innovative storyline branching model, and a true cultural icon of the 2010s. Would've been my top favourite game of all-time if I didn't get spoiled a lot by the internet about it, though.

### Night in the Woods (2017)

Stunning little story-based game that made me come to terms with my mental state.

### Destiny 2 (2017)

Started playing this game when it finally moved to Steam in 2019. And I've been hooked ever since. Beautiful and addicting free-to-play looter-shooter.

### Celeste (2018)

Beautiful, challenging platformer with some storyline. And it also introduced me to the speedrunning scene!

## Photo of the Decade

Yes, I used to take photos too! When it comes to the best photos I've ever taken this decade, nothing tops this sunset photo I took from the top of Victoria Peak, Hong Kong.

Sadly, I haven't done so for quite some time now, and my camera has been lying in my room, growing dust. Would love to go back into it!

## Starter Kit of the Decade (lul)

They don't call me "professional starter kit creator" for nothing.

I think it has to be my [Phoenix + React starter](https://github.com/resir014/phoenix_react_playground), as it was the very first time I tried something different. [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) was an enjoyable, and easy-to-learn functional programming language, and you should definitely check it out when you have the time!
