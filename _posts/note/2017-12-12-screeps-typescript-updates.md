The [Screeps](https://screeps.com) TypeScript ecosystem is evolving!

The screepers/typescript team (me, [Arcath](https://arcath.net/) and apemanzilla) have been hard at work to bring you v3 of [screeps-typescript-starter](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter) and v2 of [typed-screeps](https://github.com/screepers/typed-screeps), both of which are out now.

**Read the announcement post on [Screeps World](https://screepsworld.com/2017/12/new-typescript-types-and-starter/).**
