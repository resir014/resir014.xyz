## Miracle Musical - Hawaii: Part II

![a3955451029_10](./a3955451029_10.jpg)

The first track from this album that I've listened to was "Black Rainbows", I ended up listening to the rest of the album some time after that. It's an enjoyable experience from start to end, and the last track, "Dream Sweet in Sea Major", is so good I ended up playing it on repeat for the past few days. Really good album to listen to while you're coding.

## Mort Garson - Mother Earth's Plantasia

![sbr3030-plantasia-300](./sbr3030-plantasia-300.jpg)

This was one of the greatest YouTube finds of 2018 for me. It's been my go-to album to listen to whenever I'm doing stuff, whether it's coding, or anything else. Too bad that as with many other YouTube videos, it gets taken down by copyright claims left and right.

Thank god for Sacred Bones Records for [reissuing this album](https://twitter.com/SacredBones/status/1109094528164810753)! It's now finally getting an authorised vinyl re-release, and is also now available on Spotify, iTunes, and Apple Music!
