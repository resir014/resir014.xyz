**[Broville (v11)](http://oldshoes.ca/broville)** is a fully detailed city and continent custom-built in [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net). It took over 60 people 4 years to complete this map, with the final version released in late 2016. Every single building and interior on Broville is hand-made, and a number of quests and hidden buildings/ruins/secrets are available.

I was part of the build team for this map, finishing up the structures and interior of a couple buildings. Working on this map has been a blast, and you'll definitely enjoy exploring it. This map is best enjoyed on Minecraft 1.10, but it should also work on later versions.
