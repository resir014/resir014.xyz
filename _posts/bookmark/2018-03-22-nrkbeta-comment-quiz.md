[NRKbeta](https://nrkbeta.no/), the tech and R&D wing of Norwegian state broadcaster NRK held an experiment on their sites' comments section, in order to solve the problem of trolls, angry rants, and low-quality discussions. And their solution was simple, but genius. A simple WordPress plugin requires readers to correctly answer a quiz to prove that they've read the article in order to unlock the comment box.

> "It was a basic idea," NRKbeta developer Ståle Grut told a South By Southwest crowd on Tuesday. "Readers had to prove they read a story before they were able to comment on it."
