MACINTOSH PLUS lives on!

After the most-viewed video of their infamous track, リサフランク 420 / 現代のコンピュー, was removed from YouTube due to copyright issues with its sample, the vaporwave scene went dormant for some time. But finally, thanks to the power of the internet, it was re-released as a "complete edition" with all the original, as well as a few other tracks previously never heard.

> This is it… The community re-release of Vaporwave’s most infamous album,
> complete with every included bonus track from both the cassette release, Beer
> on the Rug Release, and OESBEE Vinyl Pressing. I think it’s important we have
> a version like this preserved in case the worst happens. All files are either
> the highest quality .mp3 320kbps or a RAW .flac cassette rip.
