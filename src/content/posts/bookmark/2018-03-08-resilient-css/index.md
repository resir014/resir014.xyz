An amazing 7-part video series by [Jen Simmons](http://jensimmons.com/) on Resilient CSS, a method of writing CSS that allows use of the latest and greatest technologies, but at the same time not leaving out users with older browsers.

It's interesting being able to write CSS this way. I've been trying to make the most out of [feature queries](https://caniuse.com/#search=feature%20queries) in my website's design, and it really allows me to think foward on how to make my CSS fail gracefully on older browsers.

There are many other neat features in CSS that allow you to write resilient CSS, some of which are featured throughout this series.
