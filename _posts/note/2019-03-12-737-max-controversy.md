A couple of notes about the 737 MAX controversy:

- No, being "grounded" does not mean the 737 MAX is banned from flying for good. The 737 MAX planes are prevented to fly until the parties calling - or Boeing - finished with their investigation.
- No, not _all_ 737s are grounded. Just the new 737 MAX 8 planes, which has the catastrophic flaw with the MCAS, which caused the #JT610 and #ET302 accidents. The 737 NG planes and 737 Classic planes are all unaffected.
