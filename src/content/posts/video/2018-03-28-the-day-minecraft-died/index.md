While this video is a bit uncomfortable to watch because pokes at the
"blame Microsoft" thing quite a lot, I agree with the general sentiment.

One of the major reasons why Minecraft has been dying is, as this video mentioned,
that "we all grew up". I used to play this game during my college days with
a bunch of friends, and more and more of us started getting real-life jobs
to the point where we just don't really have time for it. Outside of that,
other games also feel more appealing.

Not to mention the fact that one might get overwhelmed at the barrage of new
features from recent not-that-good updates, re-learning the game felt way too
much of a hassle.

This comment sums up my views nicely:
