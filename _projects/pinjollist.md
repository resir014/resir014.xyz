[**Pinjollist**](http://pinjollist.now.sh/) provides open data access to P2P lending financial institutions approved by the Otoritas Jasa Keuangan. It was co-developed by me and [@mathdroid](https://mathdroid.xyz). Read [this post](https://resir014.xyz/posts/2019/08/03/the-ojk-needs-to-cut-it-out-with-their-inconsistent-data-practices/) to learn more on why we decided to start this project.

All of our platform's source code, including the tools we make to process our data, are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pinjollist/pinjollist).
