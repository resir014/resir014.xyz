Welcome to the new resir014.xyz!

What you're seeing here is an experiment in new ways of blogging. The whole idea came after reading through [this post](https://duncanstephen.co.uk/why-its-time-to-reclaim-our-digital-lives/), which made me consider restructuring the way I do online content. From now on, expect tiny pieces of free-form posts like this, which I call "Bits." I will still do long-form blog posts, although they will be much less often than usual.

As always, I still maintain my other online presence, particularly on [Mastodon](https://tilde.town/~resir014/mastodon) and [tilde.town](https://tilde.town/~resir014). Though as always, things will be slow, since I still suffer from the [Social Media Fatigue](/posts/2017/02/13/the-social-media-fatigue/), more or less.

See you online!
