Electron apps come with their own performance baggage. Therefore, there have been some people working on ways to reduce the memory footprint that Electron has. One of them is [James Long](https://twitter.com/jlongster), with their amazing [electron-with-server example](https://github.com/jlongster/electron-with-server-example).

This was a rewrite of the aforementioned example project, translated to a webpack-friendly setup with [Electron Forge](https://electronforge.io/). See [this blog post](https://jlongster.com/secret-of-good-electron-apps) by James himself to discover the benefits of this architecture.
