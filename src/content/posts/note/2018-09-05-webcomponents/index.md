Let's try something new: [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)!

A good friend of mine [@mathdroid](https://twitter.com/mathdroid) recently introduced me to [lit-html](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html), a library built by the [Polymer team](https://www.polymer-project.org/) for writing HTML templates in JavaScript with template literals.

`lit-html` is simple and lightweight, perfect for taking a break from your usual React life.

The Polymer team also built [lit-element](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element). lit-element builds on top of lit-html, adding Web Components support. In the picture above, I tried building a tiny app using [Vaadin Components](https://vaadin.com/components), an extensive collection of reusable Web Components.

I'm pretty sure Web Components will be the future of the web, and I'll be looking forward to learn more of this in the future!
