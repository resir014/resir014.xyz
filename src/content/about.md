I started getting into web development when I self-learned HTML and CSS back in high school. Nowadays I continue to build web stuff, both professionally and as a hobby.

When I'm not doing work stuff, I either contribute to open-source software, work on my own stuff, or find something else to do to keep myself occupied. When I no longer do either of those things, then something *really* bad must have happened to me.

I keep a catalogue of interests on my [tilde.town page](https://tilde.town/~resir014/). Be sure to check them out, we might have some things in common!
