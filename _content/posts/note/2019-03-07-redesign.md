Yes, in case you've missed it, this website has been redesigned again!

This is probably my most ambitious redesign to date, since I've also taken the time to clean up old components and restructure existing ones to be easier to maintain. (One component uses Hooks now!)

I've also taken the time to create a personal design system, which I'll use for this website, as well as some future applications. It's called Chungking, and I think you'll love it. You can take a look at it [here](https://resir014.xyz/design/).
