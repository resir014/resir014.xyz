Earlier this year, I posted [a list of songs](https://resir014.xyz/posts/2019/03/31/coding-soundtracks-march-2019/) fit for focused programming work. In case you haven't realised already, music often helps me getting focused. I've been compiling a lot of these songs into a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7C9Rm592oJBNnd8Zk1mE5y?si=5l6mRHLZTDqkWRjaqtB9MQ) that I play whenever I do any kinds of work that requires focus, coding or not.

Some of these songs are worth sharing, and with that in mind, I decided to compile another "Coding Soundtracks" list for my blog. I'm considering doing this series of posts periodically, we'll see if I can find the time.

## Jim Andron - Tetris (CD-i) Soundtrack

Probably my best find of the year. The [Philips CD-i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-i) as a console might have gained a reputation as a [glorified YouTube Poop (YTP) machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36f1p8QSaw). But if there's one good thing that came out of it, it's the soundtrack to the CD-i version of Tetris. You might have realised that I have a thing for vaporwave, or vaporwave-esque songs, and this early-90s soundtrack really captures that aesthetic.

## PrismCorp Virtual Enterprises - Home

PrismCorp Virtual Enterprises is one of the aliases of electronic musician Ramona Xavier, better known as Vektroid. Yes, the same Vektroid that also brought upon us [MACINTOSH PLUS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQkPcPqTq4M). This release combines vaporwave and bossa nova to incredible effect.

## French 79 - By Your Side (ft. Sarah Rebecca)

Never have I felt such awe upon discovering a new band since I came across M83. Trust me, just give it a listen.

## Igorrr - Cheval

Going further into the other end of the scale, Igorrr is one of the best "holy-fuck-what-genre-is-this-even" find of the year for me. Sure, loud, shouty music might not be a conventional focus music, but it feels just wrong to leave this out.
