Over the past few weeks, I've been helping the team at Kawal COVID-19 to build [their website](https://kawalcovid19.id/). We're a group of volunteers from many backgrounds (including, but not limited to, medical practicioners, technologists, and data scientists), helping to provide accurate and factual information regarding the recent outbreak of the coronavirus COVID-19, which has hit several countries, including Indonesia. If you want to know how this came to be, [I wrote about it here](/posts/2020/03/07/supercharging-your-nextjs-site-with-getstaticprops-and-getstaticpaths/).

[You can view the source code here](https://gitlab.com/kawalcovid19/kawalcovid19.id). We're still working on documenting our stack, as well as writing guides for first-time contributions. Please be patient!
