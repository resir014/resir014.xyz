I'm a self-taught web developer based in Jakarta, Indonesia. Currently working at [Kata.ai](https://kata.ai), helping to blur the line between high-performance engineering and good design. I'm also an extensive contributor to the open-source software community with a number of actively-maintained projects, and community contributions.

I co-founded [commonlabs ID](https://commonlabs.id/) alongside [@mathdroid](https://mathdro.id/), an Indonesian-based open-source collective created to solve local problems with performant, accessible tech. I also helped create and moderate [Frontend Indonesia](https://feid.dev/), a [Discord](https://discord.com/) community of Indonesian frontend developers to hang out, and discuss hot new frontend technologies, like React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular.

Outside of work, I also write stuff about computers and everything else on my blog, and do livestreams of coding and videogames on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/resir014).

When I no longer do either of the things mentioned above, then something _really_ bad must have happened to me.
