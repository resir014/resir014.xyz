I still stand by my stance that blaming Twitch and YouTube re: the recent "DMCA Bloodbath" is misguided, when [this](https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1320876648045170688) is _literally_ the mindset of the RIAA.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twitch gets little sympathy for the current DMCA disaster, but the RIAA (record labels) sees streamers as renegade law breakers making bank from listening to music while people play games for 10 hours. it&#39;s just so disconnected from reality <a href="https://t.co/7shD6Oi6dM">https://t.co/7shD6Oi6dM</a> <a href="https://t.co/HqTskHVd2m">pic.twitter.com/HqTskHVd2m</a></p>&mdash; Rod Breslau (@Slasher) <a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1320876648045170688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But do note that I'm not letting Twitch away scot-free. They've long needed better tools to prevent stuff like this, and they've been caught sleeping when the Music Industryâ„¢ decided to [take advantage of the pandemic](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/twitch-amazon-unlicensed-music-riaa-recording-academy-1234815503/) to make a quick buck.

Moreover, an ex-Twitch engineer recently spilled the beans, pointing out that the system Twitch has to handle DMCA takedown requests hasn't seen much change since the Justin.tv days!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last comments from me on this, I promise (ðŸ¤ž). As the person who built TwitchSupport, I know what it&#39;s like to have to be the voice of &quot;issues.&quot;<br><br>The Twitch DMCA system was not built for Twitch. This is a JTV relic built to stop pirating of live broadcasts. 1/x <a href="https://t.co/KYB54rYKMo">https://t.co/KYB54rYKMo</a></p>&mdash; Jason Maestas (@jasonmaestas) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonmaestas/status/1326929197822959617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

YouTube had to go through the exact same thing many years ago, and as a result has developed a far more robust system than that of Twitch.

Is it perfect? No.
Is it transparent? Way more than Twitch, at the very least.

Twitch has been caught sleeping. It's time for them to step up their game, and scramble to put together a more robust system to help deal with DMCA takedowns and music copyrights.

It'll be a long, hard journey, but it's necessary, since many livelihoods are at stake.
