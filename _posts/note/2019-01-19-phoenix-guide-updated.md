I've finally updated my [Phoenix with React guide](https://resir014.xyz/posts/2017/08/09/a-phoenix-react-initial-setup-that-actually-works/)! Phoenix 1.4 ships with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) by default, therefore making the setup much more straightforward than before. The long-overdue rewrite has been finished, and has also been made up-to-date following recent updates to Phoenix. The [sample repo](https://github.com/resir014/phoenix_react_playground) has also been updated.

As for part 2 of my "Migrating to TypeScript" post, it's almost finished. Stay tuned!
