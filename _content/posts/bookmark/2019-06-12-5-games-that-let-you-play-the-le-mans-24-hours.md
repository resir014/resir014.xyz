The [Le Mans 24 Hours endurance race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Hours_of_Le_Mans) is just round the corner! This grueling 24-hour long race is one of my long-awaited things to enjoy all year. And what better way to enjoy it than to _actually_ experience it in your own computer/gaming console?

A friend of mine [Adam Johnson](https://twitter.com/AJCantFail) lists out all the games that you can play to get the full Le Mans 24 Hours experience. That is, allowing you to race for a whole 24 hours, proper day/night transition, the full 24-hour layout of the Le Mans circuit, and a diverse selection of Le Mans Prototypes (LMP) and GT cars. Bring two of your friends along with the ride!
