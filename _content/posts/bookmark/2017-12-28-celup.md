CELUP (Cekrek, Lapor, Upload - lit: Capture, Report, Upload) was a viral campaign that has caused quite some stir in Indonesia. In encouraged netizens to take photos of unknowing couples engaging in public displays of affection and upload them to the internet.

Obviously, this sparked a public outrage since the campaign had crossed into the territory of invasion of privacy. And now, after the [closure of its Instagram account](http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/12/28/viral-campaign-celup-closes-instagram-account.html), I feel the need to share the above article, which contains a good write-up about the whole kerfuffle.
