Do you ever have this song that you randomly encounter out of the blue one day, but you're SURE you've heard it somewhere before, a long time ago?

This is one of them. Especially that ending, where it fades to a beautiful cover of "I Can't Help Falling in Love".

I've learned a little bit afterwards that the song was used as a soundtrack for [_Vanilla Sky_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_Sky), but I never remembered ever watching it.
