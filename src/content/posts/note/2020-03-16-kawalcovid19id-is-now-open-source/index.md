I'm pleased to announce that kawalcovid19.id is now open source!

Over the past week, I’ve been helping the team at [Kawal COVID-19](https://kawalcovid19.id/) to build their website. We’re a group of volunteers from many backgrounds (including, but not limited to, medical practicioners, technologists, and data scientists), helping to provide accurate and factual information regarding the recent outbreak of the coronavirus COVID-19, which has hit several countries, including Indonesia. If you want to know how this came to be, [I wrote about it on my website](https://resir014.xyz/posts/2020/03/07/supercharging-your-nextjs-site-with-getstaticprops-and-getstaticpaths/).

[You can view the source code here](https://gitlab.com/kawalcovid19/kawalcovid19.id). We're still working on documenting our stack, as well as writing guides for first-time contributions. Please be patient!
