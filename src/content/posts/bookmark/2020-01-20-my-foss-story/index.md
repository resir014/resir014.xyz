This is a well-written long-read that anyone involved in maintaining, or even contributing free and open-source software (FOSS) should read.

> Courteously but firmly setting boundaries is one of those magical life hacks that pays dividends once you figure out how to do it. If you don't know how to do it, then I'm not sure exactly how to learn how to do it unfortunately. But setting boundaries lets you focus on what's important to you and not what's important to others.

> Having people trust me as a programmer is an enormous responsibility and one that I do not take lightly. But that trust means others are going to be more willing to use my code, which is ultimately what I want through my participation in FOSS.
