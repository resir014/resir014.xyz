Woah, my first ever engineering blog!

Despite its age, WordPress is still popular amongst content writers and developers alike. However, we can get around WordPress limitations in the front-end by making WordPress headless.

For the reboot of [Kata.ai's tech blog](https://medium.com/kata-engineering), I wrote about how we use headless [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to build our [all-new marketing blog](https://blog.kata.ai/), and what we learned from it.
