I'm giving Firefox Quantum a try and I'm hugely impressed! It's a massive improvement over the old Firefox, so much so that it's actually usable now.

I'm going to set Chrome aside and let it be my default browser for about a week. You should give it a try too! https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
