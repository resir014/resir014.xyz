Aside from blog posts, I started to do live coding on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/resir014).

I got the inspiration to do so when I started watching art streams around early 2019. And over the course of watching them, I slowly learned the process behind drawing artworks. From the intial sketch, to lineart, to colouring and finishing touches. Watching streams from artists like [cottonwings](https://www.twitch.tv/cottonwings), [Mr_Randomnese](https://www.twitch.tv/Mr_Randomnese), or [Natsumen (aka. Capssimistic)](https://www.twitch.tv/Capssimistic) sparked that inspiration to start doing live coding streams, because I wanted to bring those experiences to web development.

I do stream video games occasionally, but I'd love to keep it on a 60/40 coding/gaming ratio.

## Schedule

I host two primary series at the moment:

- **Random Gaming Hour:** An hour or two of chill gaming session, either with or without microphones. Often stream old games as well. Feel free to interact with each other in chat!
- **Twitch-Driven Development:** A chill live coding session where I work on my projects live on stream. Mostly web-development (HTML/CSS/JS), but might try other stuff too.

**Note:** Currently I don't have a fixed schedule, but I'll try my best to stream every Tuesday night (9pm GMT +7) at the very least. If you want to keep updated on upcoming streams, go follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/resir014)! I often post stream announcements there.
